to update initial conditions for March 2022 borg runs had to change years for initial conditions data- had to go backward two years b/c our CRSS model run starts in 2021 and initial conditions need to be in terms of 2020 and 2021
(using the iniital conditions from the official jan 2022 crss run meant that the initial conditions were to start crss in 2023 b/c crmms was used to simulate 2022)
